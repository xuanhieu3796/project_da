about.1    = 1. What are replica shoes
about.2    = 2. Do replica shoes own the technology of genuine goods or only copy them?
about.21   = This is what buyers are most concerned about. To explain that we must know these things:
about.22   = Why are all the world's major technology firms outsourcing in China?
about.23   = As you know most of the world's major technology firms produce and process products in China for cheap labor. Since then the cost of processing to create a very low product. That means the profits will be very high (Super profits).
about.24   = \r\nSo understandable when the big brands of all countries cashew processing in China. Even the king of Apple technology or the most luxurious luxury fashion house like Balenciaga has started processing in ... China.
about.25   = balenciaga shoes are also made in china
about.26   = Nike and Adidas are no exception. Do you think the salary of Chinese workers is about 5,000,000 VND, while the average salary of German workers is about 50,000,000 VND, 10 times the salary of Chinese workers. If a pair of adidas shoes is made in Germany, instead of the current price of 4 million to 5 million, it will probably range from 18 million to 22 million a pair if processed in Germany. So outsourcing in China is the perfect choice of large firms
about.27   = Commitment to share technology and business problems
about.28   = When the world's hi-tech firms want to invest in China for processing, they must accept a commitment made by China that is "sharing technology."
about.29   = By now, you probably understand why China has the advanced technology of the world's largest manufacturers in all fields, from automobiles to electronics and other high-tech items.
about.2ch  = How can replica shoes own genuine technology or just copy their appearance?
about.3    = 3. Why are replica shoes the same as genuine shoes but the price is much cheaper?
about.30   = As for investors, this is a business problem when investing in China. They will weigh between having to "share technology" with getting cheap (super-profitable) workers so they decide what works best for them.
about.31   = So replica shoes have the technology of genuine shoes because of the above. A typical example is the Adidas Ultra boost replica 1: 1 shoes using "Compression Boost sole" technology like genuine ultra boost shoes with 100% smooth bounce, similar to genuine products.
about.32   = This will be authenticated when you are holding 2 pairs of shoes, 1 pair is genuine and 1 pair is replica 1: 1. You will see what the truth is. As I often say, if you don't believe me, try it (if you try it for free)
about.33   = Technology must be shared to be invested in outsourcing in China
about.34   = Why are replica shoes so similar to genuine goods that are so much cheaper?
about.35   = As mentioned above, genuine shoes are also made in China with cheap labor, raw materials are produced in huge quantities so it will be very cheap. So why do the genuine shoes on the shelves sell at a high price?
about.36   = The price of a genuine pair of shoes is inflated for a number of reasons
about.37   = \r\nThat's because when you buy a pair of genuine shoes you have to spend a lot of money:
about.38   = About 40% on "brand money" (Of course, people have spent the effort to build a big brand must have a worthy price instead).
about.39   = Royalty for designing a pair of shoes.
about.4    = 4. Are replica shoes really good and 100% genuine like the rumors?
about.40   = Advertising marketing of the company so that you know that to buy. And many other costs ...
about.41   = Finally, the cost of processing a pair of shoes (materials and workers).
about.42   = Customs tax when imported to Vietnam (if you buy goods through a distribution company) also makes the price of the shoes higher.
about.43   = If rare models like adidas yeezy, you still have to be raised by people who wear shoes (camping in line to buy shoes) and then sell for ... in the sky (about 16 million while the company price is only 4 million)
about.ch1  = Replica shoes is a premium copy product. Reproduced based on meticulously available models, with the same or exact materials from genuine shoes, but the price is much cheaper than genuine.
about.ch2  = In other words, a replica is a real replica that is almost equivalent to genuine goods, making it difficult for users to detect.
